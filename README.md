# Learn-pytorch-in-one-example
One example to learn all the core concepts of Pytorch. This repo will also work as a training template for any experiment.

In this repo, I tried to implement training routines and inference routines. Along with this, I tried to add various reference links for some of the concepts. Following concepts are implemented in the repo.

- [x] Custom weight initialization 
- [x] SAME and VALID padding for Conv2D and Pooling layer in Pytorch just like Tensorflow 
- [x] Custom Learning Rate Schedules
- [x] Cosine Anneling Learning Rate
- [x] Learning rate plotting in Tensorboard before starting training.
- [x] Custom implementation of regularization loss
- [x] Model Summary just like Keras
- [x] Reproducibility of each experiments with setting seeds for pytorch and other modules
- [x] TensorBoard Summary Support
- [x] Automatic Mixed Precision Training
- [x] Inference scripts for Pytorch and ONNX
- [x] Custom Dataloader mechanism for dataset handling 
- [x] Using pretrained models such as e.g. resnet18
- [x] Restore weights to architecture just like Tensorflow 1.x for pretrained models for finetuning purpose
- [x] Save Checkpoint during training and resume training from that checkpoint
- [x] Remove old checkpoint just like Tensorflow 1.x checkpoint saver mechanism.
- [x] Experiment management: Saving of experiment files in a separate folder during each run.
